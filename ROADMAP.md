# ROADMAP.md

## Product Vision

Power Web OS helps B2B sales and ABM teams stop working target accounts blindly. It gathers account signals, builds a dynamic Power Web around the deal, applies the customer's sales playbook, and produces explainable Access Plans with human review before execution.

## Source Requirements

Primary requirements:

- `power_web_os_concept.md`
- `Power Web OS — концепция продукта.pdf`

Reference framework:

- `mudrezzz/langgraph-document-ai-platform`
- local research checkout: `.external/langgraph-document-ai-platform` when present

Design-system source:

- `ui-design-system/START-HERE.md`
- `ui-design-system/colors_and_type.css`
- `ui-design-system/components-spec.md`
- `ui-design-system/app-prototype/`

## Delivery Model

This project is built through concentric product loops, not waterfall layers.

Each slice must leave the product:

- working;
- testable;
- documented;
- demonstrable with synthetic data;
- visible to a user through the current demo surface whenever UI behavior changes.

The demo evolves from one synthetic account to a small portfolio, then to review, feedback, persistence, and first controlled integrations.

## Status Legend

- `Backlog`: known but not ready or not prioritized
- `Ready`: ready to implement
- `In Progress`: currently being worked on
- `Blocked`: cannot proceed without clarification or dependency
- `Done`: completed and validated

## Current Iteration

### Iteration 1: Single-account product loop

Goal:

- Turn the current JSON-only planner baseline into a complete single-account product loop with workflow, artifact, and frontend demo.

Status:

- `Done`

## Slice Backlog

### Slice 0.1: Bootstrap Power Web OS repository

- Status: `Done`
- Goal: Create a product-specific repository baseline.
- User value: The team can continue implementation through documented, tested slices.
- Scope:
  - README, ROADMAP, AGENTS, docs, demo, tests.
  - Minimal Python package.
  - Deterministic Access Planner baseline.
  - Git initialization and first commit.
  - Private GitHub repository under `mudrezzz` if available.
- Out of scope:
  - Production API.
  - Real data connectors.
  - LangGraph workflow implementation.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep local research checkout `.external/` out of Git.
  - Keep source requirements in the repo.
- Tests:
  - `python -m pytest`
- Docs:
  - README and docs skeleton updated for Power Web OS.
- Demo impact:
  - `python demo/run_demo.py` prints a sample Access Plan.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Project has clear entry point.
  - Baseline tests pass.
  - Git repository exists with initial commit.
  - GitHub setup completed or manual command documented.
- Risks:
  - Bootstrap can become a template dump; mitigate by making docs product-specific.

### Slice 0.2: First closed Access Planning loop

- Status: `Done`
- Goal: Deliver the smallest complete product loop: synthetic account data -> LangGraph-compatible Access Planning workflow -> explainable Access Plan artifact -> design-system-based frontend demo.
- User value: A user can run one command, open one local demo screen, and see the current product value end to end: why the account matters, who is visible/missing in the Power Web, which routes are recommended, what evidence supports them, and what requires human review.
- Scope:
  - Backend/domain:
    - Add typed workflow state for access planning.
    - Add `AccessPlanningWorkflow` based on the `langgraph-dai` / `BaseWorkflow` pattern.
    - Keep `DeterministicAccessPlanner` as the domain policy engine.
    - Produce a stable JSON artifact with account, signals, roles, missing roles, recommended routes, evidence refs, review flags, and workflow metadata.
  - Synthetic data:
    - Keep one realistic synthetic account fixture as the canonical demo case.
    - Make fixture data rich enough to show signals, Power Web Lite, missing stakeholders, playbook rules, and top routes.
  - Frontend:
    - Add a minimal static demo screen under `demo/` or a small frontend app directory.
    - Use `ui-design-system/colors_and_type.css` and design-system components/styles.
    - Show at minimum: account context, signal evidence, Power Web Lite roles, unresolved gaps, top-3 Access Plan routes, route rationale, risk, owner, and human-review status.
    - No production CRUD, auth, CRM sync, or live connectors.
  - Demo runner:
    - Add a documented command that regenerates the Access Plan artifact from the workflow.
    - Add a documented way to open the local frontend demo against that artifact.
- Out of scope:
  - External source scraping.
  - CRM writes.
  - User accounts/auth.
  - Production API server.
  - Full responsive product shell beyond the one demo screen.
  - Pixel-perfect visual regression.
  - LLM-generated recommendations; LLM usage can come after the deterministic workflow is demonstrable.
- Implementation notes:
  - Treat this as a vertical product slice, not a backend-only task.
  - Prefer a static frontend demo first if that is enough to demonstrate the loop.
  - The workflow should be importable and testable without running a server.
  - The frontend must follow `$frontend-design-system`; consult `ui-design-system/START-HERE.md`, `colors_and_type.css`, `components-spec.md`, and relevant prototype files.
  - If `langgraph-dai` installation is slow or unavailable in a local environment, keep a clear deterministic fallback path for tests, but the workflow layer must still be implemented against the required framework contract.
  - Suggested build order:
    1. Define the Access Planning workflow input/output JSON contract.
    2. Add workflow state and workflow wrapper around the existing planner.
    3. Add a CLI/demo runner that writes `demo/output/access_plan.json`.
    4. Expand the synthetic account fixture only as much as the UI needs.
    5. Build one design-system-based demo screen that reads or embeds the artifact.
    6. Add tests and docs for the complete loop.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for workflow state validation and output contract.
  - Unit tests that route ranking and evidence refs remain stable.
  - Smoke test for the demo artifact generation command.
  - Frontend smoke check that the demo entry imports `ui-design-system/colors_and_type.css` and renders/contains the required sections.
  - Existing `python -m pytest` remains green.
- Docs:
  - Update README quick start with the new end-to-end demo.
  - Update developer guide with workflow and demo commands.
  - Update user guide with what the demo screen shows.
  - Update architecture overview if workflow/frontend boundaries change.
- Demo impact:
  - Current JSON-only demo becomes a visual local demo.
  - User can inspect the synthetic account and see the current product loop without reading code.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - `python -m pytest` passes.
  - A documented demo command generates the Access Plan artifact.
  - A documented local frontend demo opens and shows the generated/synthetic Access Plan.
  - The project imports and uses `langgraph-dai` in the access-planning workflow layer.
  - The workflow output includes evidence refs, unresolved gaps, route rationale, risks, owners, expected state changes, and human-review flags.
  - The frontend uses the committed design system and does not introduce a separate visual language.
  - The slice is demonstrable without live external services.
- Risks:
  - `langgraph-dai` is installed from GitHub and may slow setup; mitigate with documented optional install and deterministic fallback tests.
  - Static frontend may duplicate some prototype styling; mitigate by importing design tokens and keeping the screen narrow.
  - Without the future validator, design-system compliance is manual in this slice; mitigate by using `$frontend-design-system` checklist.

### Slice 0.2.1: Product app shell for Access Planning demo

- Status: `Done`
- Goal: Move the current Access Planning frontend demo into the durable Power Web OS application shell from the design-system prototype.
- User value: A user opens the demo and sees the product frame that will grow across future slices: workspace navigation, account context, top bar, and the current Access Plans workflow inside that frame.
- Scope:
  - App shell:
    - Add production React TypeScript layout components based on `ui-design-system/app-prototype/AppShell.jsx`.
    - Include sidebar navigation for `Accounts`, `Account Map`, `Access Plans`, `Signals`, `Playbook`, plus queue entries such as `My Tasks` and `Signals Inbox`.
    - Include a top bar with account context, search affordance, and current workspace actions.
    - Keep `Access Plans` as the active working screen for the current slice.
  - Current working screen:
    - Move the existing generated-artifact UI into an `AccessPlansScreen` inside the shell.
    - Use `ui-design-system/app-prototype/PlansScreen.jsx` as the layout and behavior reference.
    - Show objective/account context, top-3 route cards, route rationale, evidence, risk, owner, expected state change, and review status.
  - Future screen placeholders:
    - Add explicit placeholder states for `Accounts`, `Account Map`, `Signals`, and `Playbook`.
    - Placeholders must preserve the shell and explain that the feature is planned without pretending the functionality is complete.
  - Frontend structure:
    - Create or align folders such as `frontend/src/layout/`, `frontend/src/screens/`, and `frontend/src/components/`.
    - Keep design-system token import in `frontend/src/main.tsx`.
- Out of scope:
  - Full Account Map graph implementation.
  - Portfolio ranking.
  - Editable playbook.
  - Live signals feed.
  - Auth, production API, CRM sync, or persistence.
  - Pixel-perfect screenshot regression.
- Implementation notes:
  - This is a corrective slice for Slice 0.2: the product loop is valid, but the frontend must live inside the intended product shell.
  - Use `ui-design-system/app-prototype/README.md`, `AppShell.jsx`, `PlansScreen.jsx`, and relevant primitive references before changing frontend layout.
  - Do not copy Babel-in-browser prototype code directly; reimplement the structure in production React TypeScript with project CSS and design tokens.
  - Use `lucide-react` icons rather than copied inline prototype SVG paths.
  - Keep unavailable navigation entries visible but non-destructive: route to placeholder screens or disabled planned states.
- Tests:
  - Update frontend contract tests to require shell labels: `Accounts`, `Account Map`, `Access Plans`, `Signals`, `Playbook`.
  - Test that `AccessPlansScreen` still loads `/demo/access_plan.json`.
  - Test that unavailable screens render planned placeholder states inside the shell.
  - Existing `python -m pytest` remains green.
  - `npm --prefix ./frontend run build` remains green.
- Docs:
  - Update README/demo instructions only if the user-visible demo entry changes.
  - Update user guide to describe the shell and active `Access Plans` screen.
  - Update developer guide with frontend layout/screen/component structure.
  - Update architecture overview only if a new frontend boundary is introduced.
- Demo impact:
  - The demo no longer looks like a standalone one-off page.
  - The same generated Access Plan artifact is shown inside the durable Power Web OS workspace.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Opening the Vite demo shows the Power Web OS shell immediately.
  - `Access Plans` is the active useful screen and preserves all Slice 0.2 information.
  - Other nav items are visible but clearly marked as planned/not implemented.
  - Design-system CSS tokens and prototype shell structure are used.
  - Tests and build pass.
- Risks:
  - Reimplementing too much of the prototype can inflate the slice; mitigate by adding the shell and placeholders only.
  - Placeholder screens can look like real functionality; mitigate with clear planned-state copy and no fake actions.

### Slice 0.3: Frontend design-system validator

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Add an automated validator that catches frontend deviations from `ui-design-system/`.
- User value: Future UI slices stay visually consistent instead of relying only on manual review.
- Scope:
  - Add a script such as `scripts/check_frontend_design_system.py`.
  - Detect hardcoded hex colors in frontend/demo code.
  - Detect direct `box-shadow`, `border-radius`, `font-family`, and common color declarations when `var(--*)` should be used.
  - Detect emoji and exclamation marks in UI strings.
  - Check that frontend/demo entry styles import `ui-design-system/colors_and_type.css`.
  - Add positive and negative fixtures for the validator.
- Out of scope:
  - Full visual regression testing.
  - Pixel-perfect screenshot comparison.
  - Enforcing every component-level design rule.
- Implementation notes:
  - Make the validator path-configurable so it can check `demo/` first and a future `frontend/` later.
  - Keep false positives manageable; allow documented inline ignore comments if needed.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for allowed and disallowed snippets.
  - Smoke command for checking the current demo.
  - Existing `python -m pytest` remains green.
- Docs:
  - Document validator usage in the developer guide.
  - Mention it in frontend contribution rules.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo can be checked automatically for design-system hygiene.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Validator fails on representative hardcoded visual values.
  - Validator passes on the current demo.
  - Validator is documented and covered by tests.
- Risks:
  - Regex checks can overreach; mitigate with small fixtures and documented ignore behavior.

### Slice 0.4: Account Radar portfolio loop

- Status: `Done`
- Goal: Expand from one account to a small synthetic portfolio with account ranking and one-click drilldown into the existing Access Planning loop.
- User value: A user can see which accounts should be worked first and why, then open the same single-account Access Plan demo for a selected account.
- Scope:
  - Add 5-10 synthetic account fixtures with varied ICP fit, signals, missing roles, and playbook fit.
  - Add an `AccountRadar` domain service that produces account score, timing, signal count, confidence, and top reason.
  - Add a portfolio artifact such as `demo/output/account_radar.json`.
  - Add a frontend portfolio screen using the design system.
  - Link/select an account to show its generated Access Plan.
- Out of scope:
  - Live source connectors.
  - Full search/filter/query language.
  - Multi-user saved views.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep the portfolio data synthetic and deterministic.
  - Use the same fixture format that the Access Planning loop consumes.
  - Treat account ranking as explainable scoring, not LLM judgement.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for account scoring and ranking.
  - Smoke test generating portfolio + selected Access Plan artifacts.
  - Frontend smoke check for required portfolio sections.
  - Design-system validator runs on demo UI if Slice 0.3 is complete.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with the portfolio demo.
  - Update developer guide with fixture structure.
  - Update architecture data flow if new artifact contracts are added.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo starts on Account Radar, then drills into one account's Access Plan.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - A user can compare accounts and understand the top score rationale.
  - Selecting an account shows the already-supported Access Plan loop.
  - All outputs remain deterministic and test-covered.
- Risks:
  - Portfolio scoring can become arbitrary; mitigate by showing only simple factors and evidence.

### Slice 0.4.1: SPA frame and bilingual UI correction

- Status: `Done`
- Goal: Stabilize the current Account Radar frontend as a bounded SPA workspace and add EN/RU UI localization before adding more screens.
- User value: A user on a smaller desktop monitor can keep the profile/navigation frame visible, read the Accounts table without overlapping text, and switch the UI between English and Russian.
- Scope:
  - Fix the app shell so `html`, `body`, `#root`, and `.app-shell` are viewport-bounded and only workspace panes scroll.
  - Keep the sidebar profile card visible at the bottom of the viewport, with navigation scrolling internally if needed.
  - Make Accounts table cells overflow-safe with owned horizontal scrolling, `min-width: 0`, and ellipsis/wrapping policy.
  - Add `i18next` / `react-i18next`, EN/RU resources, a topbar language switcher, and `localStorage` locale persistence.
  - Translate UI chrome, navigation, labels, statuses, placeholders, and planned-state copy; keep generated artifact data as source-language data.
  - Update frontend agent/design-system instructions with SPA frame, small-viewport, overflow, and i18n rules.
- Out of scope:
  - Backend localization.
  - Translated demo artifacts.
  - Production routing, auth, persistence, or API server.
  - Pixel-perfect screenshot regression.
- Implementation notes:
  - Default locale is `en`; supported locales are `en` and `ru`.
  - Use the design-system tokens and app prototype frame behavior as the reference.
  - Longer Russian labels must be handled by layout rules, not viewport-scaled fonts.
- Tests:
  - Frontend contract tests for i18n resources, i18n initialization, language switcher, SPA frame CSS, and Accounts overflow rules.
  - `python -m pytest` remains green.
  - `npm --prefix ./frontend run build` remains green.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with bounded SPA and language switching behavior.
  - Update developer guide with i18n and SPA frame rules.
  - Update demo README with bilingual UI note.
- Demo impact:
  - The same Account Radar demo becomes readable on smaller desktop monitors and can be switched between EN/RU UI chrome.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Browser page does not vertically scroll for normal desktop shell usage.
  - Sidebar profile stays visible at small desktop viewport height.
  - Accounts table text does not overlap adjacent columns.
  - EN/RU switch changes visible UI labels and persists after refresh.
  - Design-system hardcode scan, tests, and frontend build pass.
- Risks:
  - Full i18n could grow too large; mitigate by localizing UI chrome first and leaving artifact data unchanged.

### Slice 0.5: Power Web Lite board loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Turn role lists into a visual Power Web Lite board with people, roles, external actors, stance, and missing stakeholders.
- User value: A user can visually inspect who influences the account and why the recommended route goes through a specific person or partner.
- Scope:
  - Extend the domain model with node/edge view models derived from current account fixtures.
  - Add stance and state fields needed by the UI: ally, blocker, unsurfaced, neutral, champion candidate, incumbent, partner.
  - Add board coverage summary: mapped roles, missing roles, route coverage, confidence notes.
  - Add a frontend board view or board section in the current demo.
  - Highlight the recommended route path using cobalt per the design system.
- Out of scope:
  - Graph database.
  - Drag/drop editing.
  - Automatic relationship extraction from live sources.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep this as a read model generated from fixture/workflow output.
  - Reuse the design-system prototype `AccountMap.jsx` as reference, but implement the smallest necessary board.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for board read-model generation.
  - Smoke test that generated Access Plan artifact contains board data.
  - Frontend smoke check for board/missing-role sections.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with Power Web Lite explanation.
  - Update architecture overview with read-model boundary.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo shows the account as a board, not just cards and lists.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Recommended route is visually connected to visible board entities.
  - Missing stakeholders are visible and explained.
  - The board remains synthetic, deterministic, and test-covered.
- Risks:
  - UI can grow too large; mitigate by keeping one board and one inspector/summary section.

### Slice 0.6: Playbook rules loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Make playbook rules visible and editable in the synthetic demo, then regenerate Access Plan routes from those rules.
- User value: A user can see that recommendations are not black-box outputs: changing allowed routes, assets, or blocked channels changes the Access Plan.
- Scope:
  - Add a small playbook JSON contract with allowed routes, blocked channels, available assets, required review, and route weights.
  - Add deterministic validation for invalid/contradictory playbook settings.
  - Add a demo playbook screen or panel.
  - Add a documented way to regenerate the artifact after changing playbook fixture values.
- Out of scope:
  - Authenticated admin UI.
  - Persisted configuration library.
  - Multi-tenant playbook versions.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep editing fixture-based if a static demo is still the product surface.
  - If a lightweight frontend state is added, keep it local-only and demonstrable without a server.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for playbook validation and route effects.
  - Snapshot/contract test for changed playbook output.
  - Demo smoke test still passes.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with playbook rules concept.

- Demo impact:
  - Demo explains which playbook rules allowed or blocked each route.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - At least one route changes score or availability based on playbook data.
  - The UI shows allowed and blocked moves.
  - All route changes remain explainable.
- Risks:
  - Editing UI may exceed the slice; mitigate by allowing fixture edit + regeneration first.

### Slice 0.7: Human review queue loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Add a minimal human-review state for Access Plans and route drafts.
- User value: A user can approve, reject, or request changes for a recommended route before it becomes an executable task.
- Scope:
  - Add review state: pending, approved, rejected, needs_changes.
  - Add deterministic review actions in a local artifact or in-memory store.
  - Add a review queue/demo panel showing pending Access Plan routes.
  - Add a review action that changes the visible route/task status in the demo.
- Out of scope:
  - Production authentication.
  - Multi-reviewer assignment.
  - Real notification flows.
- Implementation notes:
  - Follow the `langgraph-document-ai-platform` HITL pattern conceptually, but keep the first demo local and small.
  - Keep review history explicit in the artifact.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for review transitions.
  - Smoke test for approve/reject/needs_changes demo actions or CLI simulation.
  - Contract test that review history is present in the artifact.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with review queue behavior.
  - Update architecture docs with HITL boundary.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo shows that AI/planner recommendations are not automatically executed.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - A route can move from pending to approved or rejected in the demo.
  - Review history is visible and test-covered.
  - Approved route can be presented as a next task candidate.
- Risks:
  - Browser-only state may not persist; acceptable for this slice if documented.

### Slice 0.8: CRM feedback simulation loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Simulate CRM task export and outcome feedback without integrating a real CRM.
- User value: A user can see how an approved Access Plan move becomes a task and how an outcome updates the Power Web state.
- Scope:
  - Add local CRM task artifact with owner, due date/status, route, account, and expected state change.
  - Add synthetic outcomes: replied, no_reply, intro_made, meeting_booked, blocker_found, champion_found.
  - Add a feedback application service that updates role state and board summary from outcome data.
  - Add frontend task/outcome section in the demo.
- Out of scope:
  - Real CRM API.
  - Two-way sync.
  - Scheduling or reminders.
- Implementation notes:
  - Treat CRM as a simulated system of record using local artifacts.
  - Keep Power Web OS as system of strategy: it recommends and updates strategy state from outcomes.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for task creation and outcome-to-state update.
  - Smoke test for approved route -> local task -> outcome -> updated artifact.
  - Frontend smoke check for task/outcome sections.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with the simulated feedback loop.
  - Update architecture overview with CRM boundary.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo becomes a closed loop: recommend, approve, create task, apply outcome, update board.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Applying a synthetic outcome visibly changes account/Power Web state.
  - The task artifact is generated and documented.
  - No live CRM is required.
- Risks:
  - Simulated CRM can be mistaken for production integration; mitigate with clear UI/docs labeling.

### Slice 0.9: Local persistence loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Persist the demo state locally so the user can rerun the product loop without losing approved routes, tasks, and outcomes.
- User value: A user can treat the demo as a small working product session rather than a regenerated static page.
- Scope:
  - Add local persistence using SQLite or JSON state files, choosing the smallest maintainable option.
  - Persist accounts, generated plans, review actions, tasks, and outcomes.
  - Add reset/reseed command for deterministic demo data.
  - Add UI state restoration where applicable.
- Out of scope:
  - Production Postgres migrations.
  - Multi-user tenancy.
  - Cloud deployment.
- Implementation notes:
  - Prefer JSON files if static demo architecture remains dominant; prefer SQLite if query/update complexity justifies it.
  - Keep reset command simple and documented.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for repository read/write/reset.
  - Smoke test for generate -> persist -> reload.
  - Existing product-loop tests remain green.
- Docs:
  - Document local state location and reset command.
  - Update architecture persistence section.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo can show state continuity across runs.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Demo state survives a rerun.
  - Reset returns to known synthetic baseline.
  - Persistence is isolated from domain logic behind a small interface.
- Risks:
  - Persistence can pull the project toward infrastructure work; keep it local and demo-oriented.

### Slice 0.10: Account Radar batch loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Run the portfolio loop as a batch workflow over all synthetic accounts and produce a weekly-style recommendations artifact.
- User value: A user can see the product act as an account radar, not only as a manual single-account analyzer.
- Scope:
  - Add batch runner for all fixture accounts.
  - Produce ranked weekly recommendations with top changed accounts and recommended next actions.
  - Add frontend section for latest radar run.
  - Include partial-failure handling for bad fixtures.
- Out of scope:
  - Celery/Redis production async.
  - Live scheduled jobs.
  - Email/slack notifications.
- Implementation notes:
  - Use the `async_batch` pattern conceptually, but keep local execution deterministic.
  - Emit per-account item status and aggregate summary.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for batch summary and partial failure.
  - Smoke test for portfolio batch artifact generation.
  - Demo smoke check for radar run section.
- Docs:

  - Update user guide with weekly radar concept.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo shows portfolio-level recommendations generated in one run.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Batch output contains item-level status and aggregate counters.
  - One bad fixture does not break the full demo if `continue_on_error` is enabled.
  - User can inspect batch recommendations and drill into an account.
- Risks:
  - Batch scope can grow toward production orchestration; keep live scheduling out of scope.

### Slice 0.11: Evidence/source governance loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Make source provenance, quality notes, and compliance restrictions visible in the demo.
- User value: A user can trust why a recommendation exists and see where the system refuses or warns.
- Scope:
  - Add source metadata: source type, collected_at, confidence, allowed_usage, compliance notes.
  - Add quality gates for weak or missing evidence.
  - Add UI evidence drawer or section per route/signal.
  - Add visible warnings for restricted channels or low-confidence evidence.
- Out of scope:
  - Legal policy engine.
  - Real PII governance.
  - Automated scraping compliance.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep governance rules simple and explicit.
  - Reuse evidence refs already present in Access Plan artifacts.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for evidence quality classification.
  - Contract tests that low-confidence evidence affects warnings/review flags.
  - Frontend smoke check for evidence/governance sections.
- Docs:
  - Update user guide with evidence and compliance language.
  - Update architecture docs with source governance boundary.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo shows white-box source traceability instead of only route cards.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Each recommendation links to visible evidence metadata.
  - Weak/restricted evidence changes UI warnings or review flags.
  - The demo remains deterministic.
- Risks:
  - Compliance wording can overpromise; keep labels scoped to demo rules.

### Slice 0.12: Controlled first live input loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Add one controlled, user-provided input path that turns real-ish local data into the same product loop.
- User value: A user can bring a small CSV/JSON export and see it flow through Account Radar, Power Web Lite, Access Plan, review, and task simulation.
- Scope:
  - Support import of a local CSV/JSON file with account names, URLs, CRM notes, known contacts, or signal notes.
  - Validate and normalize imported data into the existing fixture contract.
  - Show import results and validation warnings in the demo.
  - Generate the same artifacts and UI views as synthetic data.
- Out of scope:
  - Direct CRM API.
  - Web scraping.
  - Bulk enrichment.
  - Sensitive data handling beyond local files.
- Implementation notes:
  - Prefer local file import over live API as the first real-user loop.
  - Keep sample import file committed for repeatable tests.
- Tests:
  - Parser tests for valid/invalid import files.
  - Smoke test from sample import -> portfolio -> selected Access Plan.
  - Demo smoke check for import status.
- Docs:
  - Document import format and limitations.
  - Update user guide with sample import walkthrough.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo can run with synthetic data or a local imported file.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Sample import produces the same product loop as synthetic fixtures.
  - Invalid rows produce clear validation messages.
  - No external services are required.
- Risks:
  - User data may contain sensitive content; document local-only behavior and ignore real secrets.

### Slice 0.13: First CRM adapter spike as a product loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Replace the simulated CRM export with one real but optional CRM/file adapter path while keeping the same review-first product flow.
- User value: A user can take approved demo tasks out of Power Web OS into a real working system or a portable file.
- Scope:
  - Choose the first adapter based on open question resolution: file export, HubSpot, Salesforce, Bitrix24, or amoCRM.
  - Add adapter interface and one implementation.
  - Keep credentials out of repo and document setup.
  - Add an optional demo path that exports approved tasks.
- Out of scope:
  - Full two-way sync.
  - Production OAuth app.
  - Multiple CRM adapters.
- Implementation notes:
  - Prefer file export if CRM choice is unresolved.
  - Use tool/executor-style boundaries for auditability.
  - Never execute export before human review approval.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for adapter payload mapping.
  - Smoke test with file/mock adapter.

  - Demo shows approved route -> exportable task.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Export is optional, reviewed, and test-covered.
  - No secrets are committed.
  - Existing synthetic loop still works without CRM setup.
- Risks:
  - CRM choice can block implementation; mitigate with file export fallback.

### Slice 0.14: First source connector spike as a product loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Add one controlled source connector that enriches account signals while preserving source provenance and review.
- User value: A user can see the product ingest a real source-like feed and improve Account Radar or Access Plan recommendations.
- Scope:
  - Choose one source: procurement fixture/API, HH export, company site notes, news feed, or CRM history export.
  - Add connector interface and one implementation.
  - Normalize connector output into existing signal/evidence contracts.
  - Show new/updated signals in the same demo UI.
- Out of scope:
  - Broad scraping.
  - Multiple source connectors.
  - Automated outreach or contact harvesting.
- Implementation notes:
  - Prefer file/API source with stable test data.
  - Keep source provenance mandatory.
  - Do not weaken compliance/governance rules.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for connector normalization.
  - Smoke test for source input -> signal -> Access Plan change.
  - Fixture-based tests for failures/empty results.
- Docs:
  - Document source setup, limitations, and provenance.
  - Update user guide with source-enriched demo path.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo can show before/after signal enrichment for one account or portfolio.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Connector output changes at least one visible recommendation or evidence note.
  - Source refs are visible in UI.
  - Demo remains runnable without the live connector by using fixture fallback.
- Risks:
  - Live source instability; mitigate with committed fixture fallback and optional live mode.

### Slice 0.15: Pilot package loop

- Status: `Backlog`
- Goal: Package the current product as an ABM Access Pilot demo suitable for a 50-100 account pilot narrative.
- User value: A stakeholder can understand what a real pilot would include, how to run it, and what success metrics are tracked.
- Scope:
  - Add a pilot summary report artifact from current synthetic/batch state.
  - Add KPI counters: relevant accounts, generated Access Plans, approved moves, tasks created, outcomes applied, missing roles surfaced.
  - Add demo screen/section for pilot summary.
  - Add docs for pilot workflow and acceptance criteria.
- Out of scope:
  - Real customer deployment.
  - Billing/packaging.
  - Production analytics warehouse.
- Implementation notes:
  - Keep the report generated from existing artifacts.
  - Use the product's own concepts: Account Radar, Power Web, Access Plan, review, feedback.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for KPI aggregation.
  - Smoke test for pilot report generation.
  - Demo smoke check for pilot summary section.
- Docs:
  - Add pilot walkthrough to user guide.
  - Update README with current demo maturity.
- Demo impact:
  - Demo tells a complete pilot story, not just a feature story.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Pilot report is generated from current demo data.
  - KPI values are traceable to artifacts.
  - User can present the current product loop end to end.
- Risks:
  - Pilot narrative can overstate readiness; label synthetic/demo status clearly.

## Blocked Items

None.

## Open Questions

- Which CRM should be the first integration target: file export, HubSpot, Salesforce, Bitrix24, amoCRM, or another system?
- Which Russian/CIS data source should be first: procurement, HH, company websites, news, CRM history, or a partner ecosystem file?
- Should the first durable UI be static demo, lightweight local web app, or API-backed app after Slice 0.2?
- Should local persistence use JSON files or SQLite when Slice 0.9 starts?
- Should the repository remain proprietary/private long term?

## Next Recommended Task

Complete `Slice 0.3: Frontend design-system validator`.
